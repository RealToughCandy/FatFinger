## This is an oversized, real fingerprint using jQuery to transform your cursor into a stealth-level testing device for laptop touch screens and mobile devices. ## 
Resize your screen and instantly test for mobile! Does the finger bump into other things? Time to
optimize for fat fingers. Test this creation using my index.html starter sheet. Would be cool to add heat maps. I welcome all improvements to this project and would love to approve pull requests.
