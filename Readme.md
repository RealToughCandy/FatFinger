## This is an oversized (yet lifesize), real fingerprint using jQuery to transform your cursor into a stealth-level testing device for laptop touch screens. ## 
Resize your screen and instantly test for mobile! Does the finger bump into other things? Time to
optimize for fat fingers. Test this creation using my index.html starter sheet. I welcome all improvements to this project and would love to approve pull requests! ##
